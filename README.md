The universal jailbreak tool is available in "exploit-backup". This tool supports versions 2.9.8 to [6.41rc56](https://twitter.com/KirilsSolovjovs/status/949037242621849601). To use it, download the folder and launch exploit_full.sh.

Later versions 6.41 to 6.44.3 (and beyond) are supported by the universal jailbreak tool in "exploit-defconf". Under most circumstances this requires that your device supports attaching a disk, e.g. via USB port.

The current version of the stand-alone jailbreak and password recovery tool is available from: http://02.lv/f/2018/01/06/MT_JB_0.92.ova. This tool supports all current versions including 6.41+. **Please note that updating your device at any point after the jailbreak might make it unstable or brick it.**
