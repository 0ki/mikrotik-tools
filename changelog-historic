What's new in 6.38 (2016-Dec-30 11:33):

Important note!!!
RouterOS v6.38 contains STP/RSTP changes which makes bridges compatible with IEEE 802.1Q-2014 by sending and processing BPDU packets without VLAN tag.
To avoid STP/RSTP compatibility issues with older RouterOS versions, upgrade RouterOS to v6.38 on all routers in Layer2 networks with VLAN and STP/RSTP configurations.
The recommended procedure is to start by upgrading the remotest routers and gradually do it to the Root Bridge device.
If after upgrade you experience loss of connectivity, then disabling STP/RSTP on RouterOS bridge interface will restore connectivity so you can complete upgrade process on your network.

*) sstp - report TLS encryption as well;
*) safe mode - do not allow user with less permissions to disrupt active safe mode;
*) console - print command does not try to reuse item numbers assigned by

configuration values;
*) api - use the same syntax for property values as is used in 'print detail'
output, with the exception of numbers, that are not shown with suffixes
(K/M/G/T or bitrate) and are not contracted or separated into digit groups,
and "yes"/"no" values that continue to be reported as "true"/"false".
*) console - show internal numbers in the form returned by 'find' (like *9A0F)
instead of "(unknown)" when configuration refers to

An example. Previously the following command
/ip route print where routing-mark!=nosuch
Would not print routes that had no value for 'routing-mark' set, because
(nil != "nosuch") was equal to nil. Now it evaluates to 'true', and this
command will also print all routes that have no 'routing-mark' value set.

      '/interface ovpn-client', fixed;
    fixed problems with export:
        some settings were not included in full export, such as
	  '/interface wireless nstreme');
	some settings had duplicate entries with an error, such as
	  '/system ntp client' when ntp package was enabled;

   in console;
*) console - changed behaviour of '.' operator when one or both of operands
    is an array, now it produces an array with all pairwise concatenated
    elements of left and right arrays. An example:
    if $A contains array 1,2,3,4, then
    :foreach i in="10.$A.$A.0/24" do={:put $i} will print 16 network prefixes.
    Currently behaviour of '.' operator  with an empty array value is
    undefined.

*) console - compatibility syntax for 'find' and 'print where' expressions.
    If = or != operation has as the left operand name of item property, without
    leading '$', then right hand operand is parsed according to the syntax
    of that propery. This also adds back command line completions. Example:
      /ip address print where interface=ether1
    ether1 was parsed as a reference to variable "ether1", now it is parsed as
    name of the interface, like in version 2.9;

    on wireless interface;
*) fixed problem - connection tracking entries could not be removed sometimes;
*) ospf - don't install AS external routes with local address as gateway;
*) ospf - fixed bug triggered by adding and removing same AS external route
   on two routers; that route could always remain in OSPF routing table;

New features commentary:

*) installation and boot of USB sticks/drives with RouterOS
   Netinstall can now install RouterOS on USB drives.  Minitowers 
   and rackmounts with bios's that support USB boot can now easily boot 
   from USB flash/hard drives.  The USB flash sticks are available in 
   most electronics stores and are a suitable replacement from IDE 
   flashdrives and CF with IDE adaptors.  It might be advisable to find 
   a secure place to connect the USB stick so that it can't be knocked 
   off easily.  As of v3rc2,there is one problem that you should not 
   have a hard drive with RouterOS in the same system or the boot 
   program on the USB drive will find the hard drive with RouterOS and 
   probably boot that instead of the RouterOS on the USB stick -- we 
   will work on fixing this.
*) RFC 2217 serial server TCP to serial
   Now you can set the serial port to RFC 2217 server mode and 
   you can use a remote application to communicate/control the serial device.
   Find out more about this protocol at http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2217.html
